1.6:
 - Fixed constant GC generation by idle Launcher
 - Added Launcher2D which supports 2D colliders
 - Added simple 2D game demo scene with reflections

1.5b
 - minor compatibility changes

1.5
 - added playback messages
 - added Clamp playback type
 - added Size Multiplier variable which allows scaling ray system as a whole
 - changed left-over particles system behaviour(fixed null reference errors, better perfromance)
 - changed particles emission mechanism (more stability in emissions, randomization support)
 - fixed interframe interpolation for emission shape (no more rogue particles at the start of the system)
 - added new ready-to-use ray prefabs - fire ray, ice ray, oscillating plasma ray
 

1.4b
 - fixed Touched object messaging when combined with physical propagation
 - fixed shape transforms check at startup (now includes shape points)

1.4
 - added physical ray propagation (ArcReactor_Launcher)
 - added Touched object messaging (ArcReactor_Launcher)
 - added Shape curves settings (ArcReactor_Arc)
 - Complex nesting - now you can nest arc to 2 other arc with mix coefficient (ArcReactor_Arc)
 - Shape texture option added (ArcReactor_Arc)
 - improved Noise texture controls (ArcReactor_Arc)
 - Combined shape definition - supports mixture of Transforms and Vector3's (ArcReactor_Arc)
 

1.3c
 - added ray fading

1.3b
 - Disabled no reciever error message for events
 - fixed lacking of messaging on non-reflecting rays

1.3
 - Shuriken Particles emitting from rays
 - "freeze" toggle allows stopping ray timeline progression
 - added ArcReactorHit class for transmitting hit info in messages
 - changed main logic of ArcReactor_Launcher from Update to LateUpdate to prevent rendering order issues
